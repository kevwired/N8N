Business: KF Barbers
Category: Retail
Generated: 2025-08-02 19:35

Target Audience: Primary Target Audience: Local men aged 25-55 in Arbroath and surrounding areas seeking professional barbering services. This includes working professionals, fathers, and traditional gentlemen who value quality craftsmanship and reliable service. Secondary Audience: Parents with young boys (ages 3-16) looking for a patient, child-friendly barber who can handle first haircuts and nervous children with skill and care. Tertiary Audience: Men seeking traditional services like hot shaves and beard grooming, including older gentlemen who appreciate classic barbering techniques. Geographic Focus: Primarily Arbroath locals, but customers willing to travel for quality service. Customer Demographics: Middle-income families, working professionals, and retirees who prioritize quality over low prices. Decision Drivers: Consistency in service quality, friendly professional atmosphere, accommodation of walk-ins, and exceptional skill with children. Pain Points: Finding reliable barbers who can handle both adult precision cuts and patient child services, consistent availability, and maintaining traditional barbering standards.
Brand Voice: Professional, confident, and community-focused with a warm, welcoming tone. KF Barbers communicates with the expertise of traditional craftsmanship while maintaining modern accessibility. The voice should reflect pride in barbering skills, patience with all customers (especially children), and genuine care for the Arbroath community. Avoid overly casual language but remain approachable. Emphasize quality, reliability, and the personal touch that sets apart a skilled barber from generic hair salons. Use terminology that respects traditional barbering while being inclusive to modern customers.
