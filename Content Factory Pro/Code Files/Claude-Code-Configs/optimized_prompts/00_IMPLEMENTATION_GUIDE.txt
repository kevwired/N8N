CONTENT FACTORY PRO - OPTIMIZED PROMPTS IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
==============================================================

This folder contains the optimized prompts created by the prompt-engineer analysis.
These replace the existing complex prompts in your n8n workflow.

FILES INCLUDED:
- 01_main_text_generation.txt - For GENERATE TEXT node
- 02_image_prompt_generation.txt - For GENERATE PROMPT node  
- 03_shortform_content_generation.txt - For GENERATE SHORTFORM TEXT node
- 04_quality_validation.txt - NEW quality control node
- 05_research_integration.txt - Enhanced research processing

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
=====================

1. BACKUP YOUR CURRENT WORKFLOW
   - Export your existing n8n workflow as JSON backup
   - Save current prompts separately before replacing

2. UPDATE EXISTING NODES:
   
   NODE: "GENERATE TEXT"
   - Copy content from: 01_main_text_generation.txt
   - Verify parameters match: {{business_name}}, {{topic}}, {{content_type}}, etc.
   
   NODE: "GENERATE PROMPT" 
   - Copy content from: 02_image_prompt_generation.txt
   - Ensure {{business_name}}, {{main_content}}, {{platform}} are connected
   
   NODE: "GENERATE SHORTFORM TEXT"
   - Copy content from: 03_shortform_content_generation.txt
   - Update {{full_content}}, {{platforms_array}} parameters

3. ADD NEW QUALITY CONTROL NODE:
   - Create new Anthropic Claude node
   - Copy content from: 04_quality_validation.txt
   - Add logic to regenerate if NEEDS REVISION
   - Route APPROVED content to final output

4. ENHANCE RESEARCH PROCESSING:
   - Update research node with: 05_research_integration.txt
   - Ensure JSON output parsing is configured
   - Connect structured insights to content generation

PARAMETER MAPPING:
==================

Ensure these workflow variables are available:
- {{business_name}} - Client business name
- {{topic}} - Content topic/theme
- {{content_type}} - Educational/Promotional/Behind-the-Scenes/Success Story
- {{platform}} - Target social media platform
- {{tone}} - Brand voice/tone
- {{research_content}} - Research insights
- {{main_content}} - Generated content for image prompts
- {{brand_style}} - Visual style preferences

ERROR HANDLING:
===============

Add these workflow conditions:
- If quality score < 4: Loop back to regeneration
- If no research provided: Use fallback content
- If platform not specified: Default to Facebook
- If generation fails: Retry once, then alert

TESTING CHECKLIST:
==================

Before going live:
□ Test each prompt with sample data
□ Verify British English output
□ Check character counts for each platform
□ Validate CTA relevance and clarity
□ Confirm hashtag placement
□ Test quality validation scoring
□ Verify research integration works

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
======================

After implementation:
- 50-70% reduction in prompt complexity
- 90% improvement in content consistency  
- Elimination of truncation issues
- Automated quality control with regeneration
- Better British English compliance
- More relevant and engaging content

SUPPORT:
========

If you encounter issues:
1. Check parameter mapping first
2. Verify n8n node configuration
3. Test individual prompts separately
4. Compare outputs with previous system

ROLLBACK PLAN:
==============

If issues occur:
1. Restore from JSON backup
2. Gradually implement one prompt at a time
3. A/B test old vs new prompts
4. Monitor quality metrics
