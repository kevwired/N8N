Hello [Name],

Thank you for your enquiry about Content Factory Pro. I appreciate you taking the time to reach out.

I imagine you're facing the same challenge most business owners describe to me: 

You know social media matters for your business, but creating consistent, professional content feels overwhelming.

Perhaps you recognise this scenario. You finally craft a brilliant post that gets great engagement, then life gets busy. Weeks pass before you post again. By then, your audience has moved on and forgotten that initial connection you made.

Here's what I've learned after working with dozens of businesses. Consistency beats perfection every time. Your audience needs to see you regularly, not screaming "buy my stuff" but adding genuine value, sharing your expertise, building real relationships.

When someone is finally ready to buy what you offer, you want them to think of you as the obvious choice. The business owner who's been helpful, knowledgeable, and present. Not the one they vaguely remember from that great post three months ago.

This is precisely why I created Content Factory Pro.

Each month, I deliver 12 professional posts that build these relationships consistently. Not sales-heavy content, but valuable insights that position you as the expert in your field. The posts arrive ready to share, maintaining that crucial connection with your audience.

We also have monthly strategy calls. This isn't about selling you something and disappearing. These sessions keep me updated on your business developments and give you someone to hold accountable for your marketing results.

As I get to know your business better, I often spot other areas where automation could save you time and money. Most business owners are surprised by how many manual tasks they're doing that could be streamlined. It's one of the unexpected benefits of working together long-term.

The results speak for themselves. Calum Brodie from BGK Goalkeeping Academy explains: "With Kevin's help, we went from posting once a month to posting 8 highly targeted posts per month. I was so impressed with the service, I signed my second company up to it."

Ian Grant from ILG Plumbing and Heating adds: "As a busy business, we never found the time to post on social media. With Kevin's help, we managed to go from never posting to posting about our work and other services, which has helped to grow our business."

The investment is Â£120 monthly (or Â£1,000 annually, saving you Â£440), which replaces what most businesses spend on
- Hours of content creation time each week
- Strategy consultations (typically Â£150+ per session)
- Professional copywriting services
- Image creation and editing

Most marketing agencies charge Â£4,000+ monthly for similar services.

I'd like to schedule a brief consultation to discuss your specific situation and demonstrate how this approach works for businesses in your sector. The call takes approximately 15 minutes and there's no obligation.

Please note that I currently work with 8 businesses and am accepting just 7 more clients this quarter to maintain service quality and personal attention.

Your first month is complimentary, allowing you to experience the service risk-free.

Best regards,

Kevin Middleton
Founder, Content Factory Pro

P.S. Every day you delay is another day your competitors build their professional presence whilst you remain stuck in the content creation cycle.
