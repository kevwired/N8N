Even though ChatGPT doesn’t directly access Google, your Google Business Profile (GBP) still plays a major role.

Here’s why:

Many websites that ChatGPT references - like local blogs, review roundups, and directories, pull their info from Google.

A well-optimized GBP helps your business appear in the Google Map Pack, which is often mirrored by Bing or indirectly influences content ChatGPT sees.

It reinforces your brand credibility across the web, boosting trust and visibility.

To optimize:

Keep your NAP info consistent across Google, Bing, and all citations

Add high-quality photos and updated service details

Encourage customers to leave Google reviews

Use keyword-rich descriptions and Q&A

Strong GBP = stronger local authority, which feeds back into where ChatGPT gets its info.
