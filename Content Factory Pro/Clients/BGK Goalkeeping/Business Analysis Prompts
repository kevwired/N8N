BUSINESS CONTEXT

Company: BGK Goalkeeping
Industry: Sports Coaching & Training / Youth Football Development
Location: Tayside, Scotland (serving Scotland, expanding to Aberdeen and North-East)
Business Model: Individual goalkeeper coaching service combined with direct-to-consumer goalkeeper equipment sales. Founded by former Dundee FC goalkeeper Calum Brodie (UEFA B licensed, BSc Sports Coaching qualified). Dual revenue streams: 1) One-to-one and small group coaching sessions for youth goalkeepers aged 8-18, positioned as affordable alternative to expensive commercial academies; 2) Affordable, durable goalkeeper gloves and equipment sold direct-to-consumer. Current revenue: Estimated £50,000-£75,000 annually based on hundreds of goalkeepers served, partnerships with 12 clubs across Tayside, and expansion plans with hundreds of goalkeeper customers across Scotland and growing USA presence
Target Market:

Primary: Parents of youth goalkeepers aged 8-18 in Tayside and surrounding Scottish areas seeking individual development and confidence building through qualified, evidence-based coaching
Secondary: Local Scottish football clubs requiring specialist goalkeeper coaching services and grassroots football coaches seeking goalkeeper expertise
Tertiary: Scottish football community interested in evidence-based youth development and goalkeeper equipment customers seeking affordable alternatives to premium brands


Current Challenges:

Scaling individual coaching model whilst maintaining quality and personal attention that differentiates from mass academy approach
Managing geographic expansion (Aberdeen launch planned, potential North-East England growth) without losing local Scottish community focus
Balancing anti-establishment positioning against commercial academies with professional growth and credibility building
Equipment supply chain management from Pakistan whilst maintaining quality standards and competitive pricing against brands like Adidas/Nike
Building sustainable revenue model that doesn't rely solely on founder Calum Brodie's personal coaching capacity
Competing against established academies with larger marketing budgets and professional facilities
Maintaining research-based credibility (published goalkeeper research) and UEFA qualification standards whilst scaling operations efficiently
