# BGK Goalkeeping Strategic Analysis
## Executive Summary

### Strategic Situation Assessment

BGK Goalkeeping stands at a remarkable inflection point in the Scottish youth football market. Like any memorable brand that Seth Godin would champion, BGK has identified a genuine problem worth solving: the gap between expensive commercial academies and quality individual goalkeeper development. 

The business, founded by former Dundee FC goalkeeper Calum Brodie, operates a dual-revenue model combining personalised coaching services with direct-to-consumer goalkeeper equipment sales. Current annual revenue sits between £50,000-£75,000, serving hundreds of young goalkeepers across Scotland with expanding presence in the USA.

What makes BGK truly compelling is its anti-establishment positioning against traditional academy models. As Alex Hormozi would say, this isn't just a business - it's a movement that solves a real pain point for working families seeking quality football development without academy premium pricing.

**Critical Opportunities:**
